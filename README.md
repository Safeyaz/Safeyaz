Hi there, my name is Safeya, and I'm a final-year student of Computer Science Engineering.  

  *I enjoy coffee and having lengthy discussions about the universe (quantum physics and cosmology keep me up at night* :))
 
üìçCutesy stuff I did:
- **Section Leader, Stanford: Code in Place**  
 Guided multiple teams of students selected for the program and taught them the fundamentals of programming.
 
- **Research Intern, IA Portugal Summer Research Assistant**  
  Worked on a science communication project focused on astronomy education, and designed a research poster to make complex concepts accessible to all.

- I experimented with front-end development and created responsive websites. I took part in hackathons, which were great for testing teamwork, creativity, and working under pressure.

Above all, I enjoy learning, whether it's delving into the inner workings of the universe or discovering how things operate behind the scenes, I'm always searching for the next "wait... what?" moment..  
Feel free to connect if you'd like to collaborate, or geek out about space and science :)

Cheers!
Safeya üåº
